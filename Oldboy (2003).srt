What?

4
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,310
I said

5
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,900
I want to tell you my story.

6
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,399
What the hell?

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,570
Why are you talking like that?

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,950
Who the fuck are you?

9
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,420
My...

10
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,250
name is...

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,470
Oh...

12
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,510
..Dae-su.

13
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,259
Stop flirting with his girlfriend.

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,219
Hold on.

15
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,269
- Mr Oh Dae-su!
- Was I flirting with her? Was I?

16
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,900
OK! OK!

17
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,950
Sit down, Oh Dae-su.
You've had too much to drink.

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,209
I need to piss first.

19
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,130
I wasn't even flirting!
Motherfucker!

20
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,499
Arsehole!

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,710
Sit down!

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,470
I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,139
Fuck, I really need to piss.

24
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,180
- Isn't she cute?
- Very. Now sit down.

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,019
It's my daughter's birthday today.

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,440
I got her a birthday present.

<i>A pleasure boat

29
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,030
My name, Oh Dae-su, means...

30
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,329
.."getting through
one day at a time."

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,040
That's what "Oh Dae-su" means.

32
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,460
But...God...

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,339
Why can't I get through today?

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,260
Let me go!

35
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,100
<i>- Shut the fuck up!
- Let me go!</i>

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,120
Let go!
Get away from me!

37
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,990
Grab him!

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,950
He should be locked up.

39
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,799
I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk
and cause trouble again.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,090
Have a nice day, Officer.

41
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,509
He's usually a nice guy.

42
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,759
Let's go.

43
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,219
I'll come back and see you soon.

44
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,849
Don't bother.

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,440
- That's up to me, arseholes.
- Hey!

46
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,689
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy...

47
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,739
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy...

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,699
Daddy's got a present
for my little Yeun-hee.

49
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,369
I'll be home soon with your present,
just wait a bit longer...

50
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,869
Let me talk to her.

51
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,829
- Good girl.
- Give me the phone.

52
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,539
Yeun-hee,
Joo-hwan wants a word with you.

53
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,130
You remember Joo-hwan, don't you?
Hold on.

54
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,969
Hello, Yeun-hee.

55
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,130
It's me, Joo-hwan.

56
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,849
So it's your birthday today?

57
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,889
Happy birthday!

58
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,769
I'll buy you
a nice treat tomorrow.

59
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,689
Hello? Oh, hello, Ja-hyun.

60
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,569
I'm sorry. I know it's very late.

61
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,699
Dae-su is on his way home.
I'm sorry. Yes?

62
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,530
Hold on.
Dae-su, it's your wife.

63
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,620
Dae-su!

64
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
Dae-su!

65
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,269
Your wife says you should hurry home!

66
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,770
Dae-su, let's get going!
Stop messing around!

67
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,669
Sir, sir.

68
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,629
Wait, come here.
Come and talk to me.

69
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,509
I won't ask you to let me go again.

70
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,889
Just tell me why I'm here, please.

71
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,309
I have a right to know why.

72
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,599
God, I've already been locked in here
for two months.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,020
Sir, wait, come here.

74
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,819
Sir, wait. What is this place?

75
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,279
Please sir, just tell me how long
I have to stay here.

76
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,569
Sir!

77
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,200
Fuck you!

78
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,080
Come here, you arsehole!

79
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,749
Son of a bitch.

80
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,879
I saw your face, arsehole.
You're dead if I get out.

81
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,379
I'm sorry!
I won't swear at you again.

82
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,010
Just tell me how much longer.
One month? Two? Three?

83
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,969
Don't go!

84
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,219
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,189
Just tell me how long,
you son of a bitch!

86
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,519
I said tell me how long,
you arsehole!

87
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Son of a bitch!

88
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,650
You fucking arseholes!

89
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,620
<i>If they had told me then
that it would be 15 years...</i>

90
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,080
<i>..would it have been
easier to endure?</i>

91
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,670
<i>Or harder?</i>

92
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,749
LAUGH,
AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WITH YOU.

93
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,920
WEEP, AND YOU WEEP ALONE.

<i>When the music begins,
gas is released.</i>

<i>When the gas is released,
I fall asleep.</i>

96
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,040
<i>Later on, I found out</i>

97
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,789
<i>that it was the same valium gas
that Russian soldiers used</i>

102

103
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,650

110
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,389
<i>As nothing of value was taken,</i>

111

<i>The only missing item</i>

<i>50 metres in length,
suddenly collapsed...</i>

138
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,009
<i>I wrote a list</i>

139
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,180
<i>of all the people I had offended,
quarrelled with and hurt.</i>

140
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,520
<i>This was both my prison journal</i>

141
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,560
<i>and the autobiography
of my evil deeds.</i>

142
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,940
<i>I thought I had lived

<i>All I could think at that moment</i>

145

<i>was that the man in the next room</i>

146
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,550
<i>probably only had one chopstick.</i>

147

<i>But...</i>

148
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,970
<i>But...</i>

149
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,400
<i>Who had imprisoned me?</i>

150
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,149
<i>Was it Yoo Heung-sam?</i>

151
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,280
<i>Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk?</i>

152

<i>Whoever it was, wait.</i>

153
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,160
<i>Just you wait.</i>

154
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,419
<i>I'll rip your body limb from limb,</i>

155
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,750
<i>and your remains will never be found.</i>

156
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,340
<i>Because I will swallow
every last bit.</i>

157
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,280
<i>One line for each year.</i>

158
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,620
<i>When I start doing this,
I am already six lines behind.</i>

159
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,120
<i>So next year will be easier.</i>

160
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,340

<i>The shorter the chopstick becomes,</i>

162
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,090
<i>the bigger the hole in the wall
becomes.</i>

163
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,930
<i>Anyway...</i>

164
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,230
<i>..time passes well.</i>

165
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,020
<i>Nine years.</i>

<i>14 years.</i>

179
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,700
<i>I'll be out in a month.</i>

180
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,499
<i>I'll be out in one month.</i>

181
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,709
<i>I'll be out.
I'll be out in one month's time.</i>

182
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,799
<i>I'll be out of here.</i>

183
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,300
<i>I'll be out in a month.
In exactly one month.</i>

184
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,140
<i>I'll need money when I get out,
so what should I do?</i>

185
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,930
<i>Should I steal or rob?</i>

186
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,150
<i>What shall I eat first?
Kimchee soup? Barbecued eel?</i>

187
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,650
<i>Anything but fried dumplings.</i>

188
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,979
<i>But where am I?</i>

189
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,900
<i>With all the car horns,
it must be the city.</i>

190
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,659
<i>The most important thing
is what floor I'm on.</i>

191
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,290
<i>What if I break through the wall
and I'm on the 52nd floor?</i>

192
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,370
<i>Even if I plunge to my death,
I'll still be getting out.</i>

193
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,630
<i>I'm getting out.
In one month, I'm getting out.</i>

194
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,820
Picture yourself

195
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,450
lying in a field.

196
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,410
When you hear the bell...

197
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,830
..you will turn your head...

198
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,840
..and look down.

199
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,800
You will see

200
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,850
an endless field of green grass.

201
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,350
The sun is shining brightly...

202
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,560
..there's a cool breeze.

203
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,500
<i>It's a human being.</i>

204
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,460
Don't stop me!

205
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,250
Mister!

206
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,050
Even though...

207
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,590
..I'm no better than a beast...

208
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,220
..don't I have the right to live?

209
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,150
Mister.

210
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,440
Even though...

211
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,820
..I'm no better...

212
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,410
..than a beast...

213
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,040
..don't I have the right...

214
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,170
..to live?

215
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,590
Yes.

216
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,670
Yes.

217
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,319
<i>The alley with the phone box
was just here.</i>

218
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,700
<i>Now there's a block of flats.</i>

219
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,990
<i>So he releases me onto the roof.
What a fool.</i>

220
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,790
I want to tell you my story.

221
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,750
Die later.

222
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,500
What?

223
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,640
What the hell?

224
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,270
I see.

225
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,110
Now I'll tell you my story.

226
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,280
The reason...

227
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,660
..I want to die is...

228
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,740
Hey!

229
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,210
<i>That's a female human being.</i>

230
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,449
<i>Laugh,</i>

231
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,660
<i>and the world laughs with you.</i>

232
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,370
<i>Weep,</i>

233
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,160
<i>and you weep alone.</i>

234
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,750
<i>My home is gone.</i>

235
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,090
<i>I cannot call
my friends or relatives.</i>

236
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,050
<i>Because they say
I murdered my wife.</i>

237
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,770
<i>I am a fugitive.</i>

238
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,210
You dickshit!

239
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,390
<i>Dickshit...</i>

240
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,180
<i>A new word.</i>

241
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,980
<i>Television doesn't teach you
swear words.</i>

242
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,790
<i>Can 15 years' worth of
imaginary training be put to use?</i>

243
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,510
<i>Apparently, it can.</i>

244
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,009
<i>Rock Bream.</i>

245
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,390
<i>Oplegnathus fasciatus.</i>

246
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,850
<i>Lives in the warm waters
of coastal reefs.</i>

247
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,399
<i>This fish has weak reflexes,</i>

248
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,400
<i>but can resist powerfully
when caught in a hook.</i>

249
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,860
<i>In the Kyungsang Province,
its offspring...</i>

250
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,780
<i>What is that smell?</i>

251
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,130
Don't bother
asking me any questions.

252
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,670
I don't know anything.

253
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,400
Yes?

254
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,530
I said... I want to eat...
a living thing.

255
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,999
Oh... right.

256
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,499
Long time no see.

257
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,249
<i>This is my first time here.</i>

258
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,709
Maybe I'm wrong.

259
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,130
<i>But she looks familiar.</i>

260
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,180
You look very familiar.
Have we met before?

261
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,510
"Search for the Best Chef."

262
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,809
"Thursdays at 6:30 on MBC."

263
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,849
"The youngest female chef
of Japanese cuisine."

264
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,400
Oh, that?

265
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,569
They said the ratings are low,
but someone must watch it.

266
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,319
Women's hands are usually warm,
so they cannot make sushi.

267
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,370
Well, you certainly know your stuff.

268
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,840
Who are you?

269
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,839
<i>Do you</i>

270
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,600
<i>like your clothes?</i>

271
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,600
Why?

272
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,980
<i>- Why did you imprison me?
- Who do you think I am?</i>

273
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,280
<i>- Yoo Heung-sam?
- Wrong.</i>

274
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,160
<i>- Did Lee So-young pay you?
- Wrong again.</i>

275
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,910
Lee Jong-yong?

276
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,040
Kang Chang-suk?

277
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,250
Hwang Joo-yeun? Kim Na-sung?

278
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,049
Park Jin-woo? Im Duk-yoon?
Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran?

279
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,260
<i>- Who the hell are you?
- Me?</i>

280
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,380
<i>I'm a sort of scholar.</i>

281
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,010
<i>And my field of study is you.</i>

282
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,969
<i>A scholar studying Oh Dae-su.</i>

283
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,730
<i>An expert on Oh Dae-su.</i>

284
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,189
<i>Who I am isn't important.
What's important is "why".</i>

285
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,859
<i>Think hard.</i>

286
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,320
<i>Study your whole lifetime.</i>

287
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,950
<i>School has finished,
now it's time for your homework.</i>

288
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,370
<i>Keep this in mind.:</i>

289
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,910
<i>"Whether it be a grain of sand
or a rock,</i>

290
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,540
<i>in water they both sink alike. "</i>

291
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,250
Let me ask you one thing.

292
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,210
You hypnotised me in there,
didn't you?

293
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,970
What did you do to me?

294
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
<i>I miss you.</i>

295
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,680
<i>Come quickly.</i>

296
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,360
Here you are.

297
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,110
It's alive, OK?

298
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,200
I'll go and slice it up for you.

299
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,030
I must be a different breed of woman.
My hands are very cold.

300
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,240
<i>What is she doing?</i>

301
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,460
Sir.

302
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,800
Sir, wake up.

303
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,380
<i>Keep this in mind.</i>

304
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,180
<i>"Whether it be a grain of sand
or a rock...</i>

305
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,770
<i>..in water they both sink alike. "</i>

306
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Are you awake?

307
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,790
Is all this true?

308
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,060
That fever remedy works well.

309
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,520
Why did you faint if you've done
so much physical training?

310
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:34,160
A lack of vital sunlight leaves one
depleted of vitamins A and E.

311
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,160
Thus, one's immunity to influenza
is weakened.

312
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,460
Do you always talk like that?

313
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,139
The lock on the bathroom door
is broken.

314
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,809
Don't get any bright ideas

315
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,230
or I'll gut you like a fish.

316
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,690
What's this?

317
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,900
Suppositories. You fainted, so
how else could I give you medicine?

318
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,420
<i>Can 15 years' worth of
imaginary training be put to use?</i>

319
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,640
<i>Apparently not.</i>

320
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,740
That was an unforgivable sin.

321
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:07,250
I brought you back here
and then turned you down.

322
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,670
I can see why you're angry.

323
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,090
I really can.

324
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:19,680
You know, I brought you here
because I like you.

325
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,760
But...

326
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,600
You don't even know my name yet.

327
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,810
It's Mido.

328
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,610
You see...

329
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,440
..later on...

330
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,860
..when I'm really ready...

331
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,990
..I swear on my life
that I'll go through with it.

332
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,210
<i>That song in your diary, The Face
I Want to See , that will be the sign.</i>

333
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,329
When I sing it,

334
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,840
get ready.

335
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,679
I may try to resist you again

336
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,390
in the heat of the moment.

337
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,519
But no matter what, don't stop.

338
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,850
Just give it to me!

339
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,650
Give it...

340
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,030
..to me.

341
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,410
The ants...

342
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,950
Do you still see them?

343
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,790
Do you still feel that way?

344
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,920
Yeah, if you're alone, you see ants.

345
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:39,220
People I have met who are very Ionely
have all hallucinated about ants.

346
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,509
I tried once to work out why.

347
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,970
Ants move around in groups,
you know.

348
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,980
So I suppose very Ionely people
keep thinking of ants.

349
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,900
Although I have never done that.

350
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,509
<i>She called from overseas
five or six years ago,</i>

351
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,800
<i>asking if her dad had come back.</i>

352
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,510
<i>She doesn't even know
that he killed her mother.</i>

353
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,520
She has hardly any relatives,
so she calls us.

354
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,310
Her Korean has got worse.

355
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,070
I think her Swedish foster parents
are both doctors.

356
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,950
You journalists must know...

357
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,409
Dae-su...

358
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,410
Is he really still on the run?

359
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,249
Your daughter's address
is on the front

360
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,340
and on the back is a map of
your wife's grave.

361
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,340
<i>Eva...</i>

362
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,560
<i>Stockholm...</i>

363
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,270
<i>Eva...</i>

364
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,310
Do you want to call her?

365
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,110
Shall I call her?

366
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,200
Shall we visit the grave tomorrow?

367
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,800
<i>No, first I have to kill
that bastard.</i>

368
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,450
BLUE DRAGON

369
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,829
Well?

370
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,410
<i>I haven't tasted it yet.</i>

371
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,250
BLUE DRAGON

372
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,750
So?

373
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,050
Did it taste the same?

374
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,270
<i>I could taste food from
100 restaurants...</i>

375
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,650
<i>..but I will never forget
the food I tasted for 15 years.</i>

376
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,290
BLUE DRAGON

377
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,520
Shall I create an ID for you,
so you can log in?

378
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,730
Do you have
a favourite film or song?

379
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,530
I've already been talking...

380
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,360
..to him...

381
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,080
"The Count of Monte Cristo"?

382
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:27,590
There's no one by that name here.

383
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,429
HOW'S LIFE IN A BIGGER PRISON,
OH DAE-SU?

384
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,020
Who are you?

385
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,320
Who are you?

386
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,239
THE LONELY PRINCE IN THE HIGH
TOWER.

387
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,780
Who is he?

388
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,450
I don't know who he is.
I just chat to him sometimes.

389
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,790
We talk about sushi.

390
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,300
Where are you going?

391
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,389
Where are you going?

392
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,350
You are not to be trusted.

393
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,789
- VIOL...
- BLUE DRAGON

394
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:49,170
<i>Violet Blue Dragon...
What does that mean?</i>

395
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,350
<i>Why did they order
from a place so far away?</i>

396
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,480
<i>I've already passed
five Chinese restaurants.</i>

397
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,860
<i>I think my lungs are
on the verge of exploding.</i>

398
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,499
You there, tell your cooks

399
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,290
to put less scallions
in the dumplings.

400
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,790
OK.

401
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,800
- Leave it there and go.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:22,099
We don't take on anyone
who uses bodyguards.

403
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,720
Some companies specialise in that.

404
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,140
You should go to them.

405
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,850
We just take the small fry.

406
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:35,860
If the stay is over six months,
transportation is free.

407
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,610
Yes, of course.

408
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,910
Why did you imprison me, you...

409
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,330
..dickshit.

410
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,750
In our business on floor 7½

411
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,760
client confidentiality
is our livelihood.

412
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,860
I am going to avenge myself
for all 15 years.

413
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,280
Each tooth I extract
will age you by one year.

414
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,680
Keep still.

415
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,770
Do you want to talk?

416
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,289
I don't know...

417
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,169
I didn't see his face...

418
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,380
I made recordings...

419
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,810
OH DAE-SU

420
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,490
All those who are blood-type AB,
raise your hand.

421
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,130
Go. Shoo!
He has lost a lot of blood.

422
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,430
Piece of shit.

423
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,150
Is he dead?

424
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,300
<i>I can't seem to</i>

425
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,300
<i>get through today either.</i>

426
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,730
<i>Now I have become a monster.</i>

427
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,230
<i>When my vengeance is over...</i>

428
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,360
<i>..can I return to Oh Dae-su?</i>

429
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,819
Mister, are you alright?

430
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,869
Look at all this blood.

431
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:03,410
What happened to you?

432
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,170
Saewoon Apartments, Eung-am,
building 8. Take care of him.

433
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,630
Thank you.

434
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,840
Not at all.

435
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,760
Well, then...

436
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,350
Farewell, Oh Dae-su.

437
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,400
<i>Farewell...</i>

438
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,770
<i>..Oh Dae-su.</i>

439
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,940
<i>Farewell.</i>

440
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,110
<i>Farewell.</i>

441
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,919
<i>The bastard you hate,
but don't dare kill.</i>

442
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,219
<i>The bitch you detest,
who deserves a fate worse than death.</i>

443
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,300
<i>We are at your service.</i>

444
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,269
<i>Won't he go crazy
if he's locked up for a long time?</i>

445
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:49,479
<i>Well, if you don't want that,
we can drug his drinks.</i>

446
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,649
<i>There's a thing
called 'Risterdal solution'.</i>

447
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:56,650
<i>It's a reliable drug
used to treat schizophrenia.</i>

448
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:00,449
<i>But it depends on the length
of the treatment,</i>

449
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:03,239
<i>so how long will he...</i>

450
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,790
<i>15 years.</i>

451
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,999
<i>Is that possible?</i>

452
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,420
<i>What did he do?</i>

453
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,710
<i>Oh Dae-su, you see...</i>

454
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,090
<i>..talks too much.</i>

455
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,510
Go to sleep.

456
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,930

<i>Oh Dae-su, you see...</i>

460
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,540
<i>..talks too much.</i>

461
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,130
Have you heard this voice before?

462
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,350
Who loathes me this much?

463
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,859
Those 260 women you've had...

464
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,149

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,489
<i>I decided when I was a prisoner</i>

486
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,330
<i>that if I got out,
I would trust no one.</i>

487
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,039
<i>If I met anyone suspicious,</i>

488
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,250
<i>I would invent a secret,
only known to the two of us.</i>

489
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,920
That ID, Monster, is a trap
I designed to catch him.

490
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,590
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

491
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,440
Who's Evergreen?

492
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:30,119
<i>I tracked down that Evergreen ID
and found the owner's details.</i>

493
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,699
<i>- Are you ready to jot it down?
- Go ahead.</i>

494
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,079
<i>It's Su Dae-oh.
Does the surname 'Su'even exist?</i>

495
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,879
<i>- Address?
- Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am.</i>

496
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,880
<i>Building 7, flat 407.</i>

497
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,589
<i>Actually, life in a bigger prison</i>

498
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,390
<i>does not suit me very well.</i>

499
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,410
Evergreen.

500
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,490
Who are you?

501
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,920
Is that what you wanted to ask?

502
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,169
No. You must find that out
for yourself.

503
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:27,050
Come on, it's a game.

504
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:31,010
First " who?"
Then "why?"

505
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,179
When you know the answer,
come and see me.

506
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,969
I'll mark your work.

507
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,390
You have until July 5th.

508
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,860
Oh no, only five days left.

509
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,650
Too short?

510
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,029
Chin up.

511
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,700
If you succeed,
I'll kill myself instead of Mido.

512
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,580
That's right, Mido.

513
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:59,789
I'm going to kill

514
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,710
every woman you love until you die.

515
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,839
Well, you're notorious

516
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,460
for not protecting your women anyway.

517
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,770
Wow, you're strong, Mr Monster.

518
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,140
Yes, you are the monster
that I created.

519
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,149
But you will never

520
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:29,070
find out why
if you go through with this.

521
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,990
You have been curious for 15 years...

522
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,450
Are you still going to kill me?

523
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,250
Sit down there.

524
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,890
Ah, the tooth torture!

525
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,510
You won't have enough time.

526
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,480
I have a pacemaker
for my weak heart.

527
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,810
When it was put in...

528
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,070
..do you know
what I said to the doctor?

529
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,780
"Dr Hopkins,

530
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,740
give me...

531
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,199
..a remote control
to turn my motor off."

532
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,080
"Pardon? Why?"

533
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,840
"So that I can kill myself. Easily.
At any time."

534
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,670
"I'll pay you an extra $100,000
for this."

535
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,189
What a dilemma.

536
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:52,279
You want to kill me right now,

537
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,400
but then you won't know
why you were imprisoned.

538
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:00,080
You want to torture me,
but I say I'll kill myself first.

539
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:05,870
Revenge? Or the truth?

540
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,840
What a problem for you.

541
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:14,470
I've been watching over you
for 15 years.

542
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,549
I've faired well thanks to you.

543
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,430
I wasn't bored or Ionely.

544
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:28,899
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for someone who has been hurt.

545
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,520
Try it.

546
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,690
The loss of 15 years,

547
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,819
the pain of losing
your wife and child,

548
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,620
all this can be forgotten.

549
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,000
Once again,
revenge is good for your health.

550
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,500
But...

551
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,670
What happens
after you've had your revenge?

552
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,380
I bet that hidden pain
probably emerges again.

553
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,390
Are you there, Oh Dae-su?

554
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,850
Oh Dae-su.

555
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,180
Long time no see.

556
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,900
Hasn't she been tied up too long?
You left her door open.

557
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,300
Save me, Dae-su!

558
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,300
<i>I can't. I'm going to die.</i>

559
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,190
This dentist is very good.

560
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,989
Keep still.

561
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,660
Keep still.

562
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,910
What's his problem?

563
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,480
You see...

564
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,070
..they say that people

565
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,610
shrivel up
because of their imagination.

566
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,780
So do not imagine anything.

567
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,160
You'll become brave as hell.

568
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,460
Now here comes the real thing.

569
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:29,200
Sir, I'm glad
you told me about this place...

570
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,160
..but I haven't even started yet!

571
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,140
Let's go.

572
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,160
Let's go now.

573
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,490
Let's fight.

574
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,000
Let's fight.

575
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,300
- What a tough guy!
- Your hand.

576
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:26,260
I'll chop off your hand.

577
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,510
You touched Mido's breasts.

578
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,310
Let's get out of this dump.

579
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,870
So do you trust me now, you bastard?

580
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,749
It looks hard to accomplish.

581
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,509
I looked into it.

582
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:07,509
The reason the bank
refused to pay $270 million

583
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:10,219
was not due to
any building irregularities.

584
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,430
They have internal problems.

585
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,729
So I don't think
we'll have any trouble.

586
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:25,570
Chairman Choi's
23 clients' shares are at 25% ...

587
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,370
Dae-su.

588
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,910
Yeah?

589
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,960
Did he really say that he'd kill me?

590
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,920
Yeah.

591
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:49,510
Because I'm the woman you love?

592
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,640
Dae-su.

593
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:00,060
What?

594
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:04,110
<i>Where is my love?</i>

595
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,690
<i>I'm getting lonelier in the nights</i>

596
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:15,280
<i>The words you send with your eyes</i>

597
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:20,500
<i>I can feel with my hand</i>

598
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:25,380
<i>So many nights have passed</i>

599
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:30,050
<i>My heart is going to you</i>

600
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:35,390
<i>As I shed my sad tears</i>

601
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:40,140
<i>You're the face I miss.</i>

602
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:48,980
They packed up their stuff
and left in a rental car.

603
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:55,370
Also, Mido called the restaurant
and left her job.

604
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,410
Let's go after this is done.

605
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,880
You should get some rest today, sir.

606
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,710
I can't even sleep.

607
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,510
Because I am Ionely.

608
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:14,720
Mr Han.

609
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,060
Do you really think...

610
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,930
..that Mido has fallen in love
with Oh Dae-su?

611
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,480
Already?

612
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,170
Dae-su!

613
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,800
It hurts so much.

614
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,010
But I'll endure it.

615
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,930
You must understand.

616
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:14,030
How did you hold out for 15 years?

617
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,160
There's always a way.

618
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,450
Do you like it?

619
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,700
You do like it, don't you?

620
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,620
I want to make you feel good, Dae-su.

621
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,530
<i>You need not worry about the future.</i>

622
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,700
<i>Imagine nothing.</i>

623
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:14,420
<i>I am grateful for
all those years spent in that prison.</i>

624
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:21,220
<i>If I was the old Oh Dae-su,
would Mido still have liked me?</i>

625
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:02,530
<i>He could only have known that I said
I would chop off Mr Park's hand</i>

626
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,200
<i>by putting a bug on us.</i>

627
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:08,200
<i>And he knew
where we were by tailing us.</i>

628
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,499
I'VE BEEN BUGGED. PLEASE FIND IT.

629
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,370
<i>You know,</i>

630
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,000
<i>maybe he freed you</i>

631
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:19,300
<i>because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge.</i>

632
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:25,180
<i>And he'll never tell you why,
so he can toy with you forever.</i>

633
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:28,640
<i>Is that why?</i>

<i>I should be locking up now.</i>

644
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,860
Can I just look at
the records for the class of '79?

645
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,240
It's dark. Put the lights on.

01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,959
Take your time.

647
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,540
LEE WOO-JIN

648
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,919
Joo-hwan?

649
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,880
Let me ask you something.

650
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:47,260
Do you remember
Lee Woo-jin from school?

651
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,970
I think he went to study in America.

652
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,970
<i>Lee Woo-jin?</i>

653
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:56,270
<i>I don't know him.
So is that the bastard's name?</i>

654
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,480
<i>How did you find out?</i>

655
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,730
<i>I looked through
all the school yearbooks.</i>

656
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,899
<i>I need more than just a name.</i>

657
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,529
<i>Got anything else?</i>

658
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:09,659
<i>Look at the student records.</i>

659
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,829
<i>Do you know Lee Soo-ah?
She was in our year.</i>

660
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:14,370
<i>Lee Soo-ah?</i>

661
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,460
<i>She died.</i>

662
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,629
<i>- What classroom was she in?
- Room two, I think.</i>

663
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,499
<i>She was in my room.</i>

664
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,460
<i>Next to yours.
So what about her?</i>

665
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,840
Why is there no photo?

666
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:33,139
She died. That must be why.

667
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,930
How did Lee Soo-ah die?

668
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,229
<i>Yeah, you wouldn't know.</i>

669
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:40,150
<i>She died after you moved schools.</i>

670
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:46,189
<i>She went to the Habchun Dam alone
and fell into the water.</i>

671
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,070
<i>She bit the dust.</i>

672
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:56,540
<i>One week later, they found
her bloated body in the water.</i>

673
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,539
<i>- What was she like?
- Her?</i>

674
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,789
She was a total slut.

675
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:05,709
On the outside,
she acted like a lady,

676
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:09,429
but inside she was just
a filthy whore.

677
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:14,430
The rumour going around school
was that she'd fuck anyone.

678
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:18,180
I should have got in there.

679
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,520
I also heard that her family
was filthy rich.

680
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,069
Her grades were good, too.

681
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:31,610
But the worst thing was
that she was a total slut.

682
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:34,699
God, this is such an old story.

683
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,369
Dae-su, I can't remember
because it was so long ago,

684
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,960
but that Soo-ah, well...

685
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,220
<i>Joo-hwan, what is it?</i>

686
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:03,770
<i>Joo-hwan, is something wrong?</i>

687
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,360
Oh Dae-su.

688
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,070
My sister...

689
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,910
..was no slut.

690
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,830
You must believe that.

691
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:28,750
You got rid of your bug so
I had to come all the way here.

692
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,880
To eavesdrop.

693
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:34,340
That's why Joo-hwan is dead...

694
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,010
..because of you.

695
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,140
OK?

696
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,660
<i>You bastard, I'm coming for you!</i>

697
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:59,830
<i>I'm going to kill you!</i>

698
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,520
You son of a bitch!

699
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:46,000
We're not open yet.
Come back in an hour, please.

700
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:50,170
This place was recommended
by someone with six gold teeth.

701
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,010
Mr Park?

702
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,310
I had to move because of you.

703
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,270
To celebrate the occasion...

704
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,189
..I installed a new TV.

705
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:11,520
Do you like it?

706
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,859
It's got so many channels.
Great, isn't it?

707
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:18,449
Some prisoners
don't want to leave at all.

708
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:22,240
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years, Dae-su?

709
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,330
After 11 years it felt like home.

710
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:30,250
Come on, I don't need your money.

711
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,840
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

712
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,969
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

713
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:42,720
I've missed you.

714
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,270
Bastard. You'll pay for this.

715
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:53,190
So why did you bring me here?

716
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,160
If I don't return after July 5th,
let her go.

717
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:11,630
While I was locked up here,
I remember someone visiting me.

718
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,379
What did that person do?

719
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,089
Was it three times?

720
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:20,799
I put a hypnosis-inducing drug
in your water.

721
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,850
Sodium barbiturate?

722
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:25,350
He's a genius!

723
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,610
WATERWHEEL HAIR SALON

724
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,539
That's rubbish.

725
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:51,170
Even though it was a Catholic school,

726
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,289
those rumours wouldn't have
killed her.

727
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,050
There was probably something else.

728
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,930
Could she have been pregnant, maybe?

729
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:07,349
I really don't think
Soo-ah was like that.

730
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,429
She was such a pure girl.

731
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:12,900
I know she never went with anyone.

732
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:18,730
But she did go out
with someone back then.

733
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:23,030
Do you want to know who he was?

734
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,530
I haven't got a clue!

735
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:41,050
Choon-shim.

736
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,800
You knew Lee Soo-ah, didn't you?
Who was her boyfriend?

737
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,470
You don't know?

738
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,729
You silly cow.

739
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:52,269
You don't know

740
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:54,809
because friendship
means nothing to you.

741
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,309
Shut up.

742
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:58,480
Who would know?

743
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,569
Who?

744
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:02,240
Joo-hwan?

745
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,490
What?

746
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:11,370
Yeah, I know him.

747
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,330
But why would he know?

748
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,670
Yeah?

749
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,750
Really?

750
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:22,010
OK. I'll call you back in a bit.

751
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,810
Well...

752
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,930
She said it was Joo-hwan
who told her the rumours

753
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:37,270
and that you should know
more than anyone.

754
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,040
<i>Ring, ring.</i>

755
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,040
<i>Move aside.</i>

756
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,170
<i>You'll get hurt...</i>

757
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:06,010
<i>..if you get in the way.</i>

758
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:19,690
OH DAE-SU

759
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,539
Good Lord!

760
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,629
You rascal. Put it out!

761
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:44,170
I'm leaving today. For Seoul.

762
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,720
So just you leave me alone, missy.

763
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,090
You good-for-nothing!

764
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,990
You're Oh Dae-su, aren't you?

765
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,949
And you are...

766
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:55,700
I heard
you're popular with the girls.

767
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:59,000
You know what rumours are like.

768
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:03,000
I heard you're really funny.
Say something.

769
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:09,510
It's not good
to be stuck with one image.

770
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,519
OK, there's this father and son.

771
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,439
They went
to the swimming pool and...

772
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,070
See you later.

773
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:55,890
TAKE CARE FUCKHEADS OF
YEAR 3, CLASS 3.

774
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:54,450
- Come on.
- Wait.

775
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,990
- Come here.
- No.

776
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:02,659
Come here.

777
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,750
OK, OK.

778
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:14,630
Satisfied?

779
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:17,389
- Lift this up.
- No way.

780
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,550
- Lift it up.
- No.

781
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,610
What?

782
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,000
That tickles.

783
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,440
Give me those.

784
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:22,949
What are you doing?

785
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:24,289
Let me see.

786
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:26,080
What are you doing?

787
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:29,210
- Let me see.
- Stop it!

788
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,180
Go away.

789
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:25,610
Was it really Soo-ah? Are you sure?

790
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:28,030
I don't know her name.

791
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:32,790
I just know that she's in your class
and she rides a red bike.

792
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:43,049
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul.

793
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,679
Where are you going?

794
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:47,220
I've got a date with Choon-shim.

795
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,220
I'll kill you if you blab to anyone.

796
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,520
<i>No way.</i>

797
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:01,900
<i>You got locked up for 15 years
just for saying that?</i>

798
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:06,320
<i>Is that such a crime?</i>

799
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:11,619
"Whether it be a grain of sand
or a rock,

800
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,160
in water they both sink alike."

801
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:19,710
That's Lee Woo-jin's attitude.

802
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:23,090
So,

803
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:25,720
what's the significance of July 5th?

804
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,340
That's the day...

805
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,930
..Lee Soo-ah died.

806
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:40,610
It's over now.

807
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:42,939
You were fighting for the truth,

808
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,490
not for revenge, weren't you?

809
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:52,080
Now, we'll run away
where Woo-jin can never follow us.

810
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,410
<i>I can't end it like this.</i>

811
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:00,790
Vengeance has become a part of me.

812
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:09,180
But you don't even know
where he lives.

813
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:13,809
<i>"Like a gazelle
from the hand of the hunter...</i>

814
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:17,189
<i>"Like a bird
from the snare of the fowler...</i>

815
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:18,770
<i>"Free yourself. "</i>

816
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,149
<i>It is taken from the Book
of Proverbs, chapter six, verse four.</i>

817
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:25,990
<i>And Evergreen...</i>

818
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:28,950
<i>..said he lives in a high tower.</i>

819
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:32,570
<i>So six and four...</i>

820
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,950
<i>..must be floors.</i>

821
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:37,450
<i>Fourth floor.</i>

822
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:40,170
<i>Sixth floor.</i>

823
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:42,460
<i>Or the 64th floor?</i>

824
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,550
<i>P?</i>

825
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,550
<i>Penthouse!</i>

826
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,310
<i>Please insert the code.</i>

827
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,650
What would you like me to pray for?

828
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:07,280
<i>Wrong entry.</i>

829
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:10,030
<i>Please re-enter.</i>

830
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:18,659
<i>Wrong entry. Please re-enter.</i>

831
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,210
"Dear Lord...

832
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,880
..please let me...

833
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,670
..meet a younger man next time."

834
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:19,770
Please make Woo-jin...

835
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,690
..kneel before Dae-su...

836
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:27,230
..and beg for forgiveness.

837
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:42,540
You slept with your sister.

838
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:55,720
Let's go upstairs and talk.

839
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,120
Get him!

840
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,230
Just talk.

841
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:17,590
That's better.

842
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,099
You slept with your sister.

843
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,850
So refreshing.

844
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:32,020
And I started the rumours.

845
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,690
That's why your sister died.

846
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:45,120
Looking in the mirror
reminds me of that day.

847
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,909
How about you?

848
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:51,630
Erasing my memory and telling me
to find the truth was cowardly.

849
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:54,380
I won...

850
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,419
..so die like you promised.

851
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:02,390
Did you think you'd forgotten
that day because you were hypnotized?

852
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:04,930
<i>Really?</i>

853
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:09,520
Do you know the real reason
why you can't remember?

854
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,020
It's because...

855
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,860
..you just forgot.

856
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,029
Is that not exciting enough for you?

857
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:26,489
Well, it's true, you just forgot.

858
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:29,580
Why? Because
it wasn't important to you.

859
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:32,379
Your rumour got so out of hand,

860
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:35,839
that the next rumour
was that Soo-ah was pregnant.

861
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,800
My sister got sucked into that rumour
and began believing it.

862
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:45,140
So her periods stopped
and her belly began to swell.

863
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,389
Fascinating, isn't it?

864
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:51,559
Imagine how a girl would feel to
carry both her child and her nephew.

865
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,600
Do you understand now?

866
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:58,690
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

867
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,910
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

868
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,030
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

869
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:13,749
Is that why you killed your sister?

870
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,379
Imagine how a boy would feel,

871
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:18,210
fathering both his child
and his nephew?

872
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:24,090
You were probably afraid.

873
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:27,720
Afraid that everyone would know
once the baby was born.

874
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:32,810
After you killed her, you realised it
was a phantom pregnancy...

875
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,730
..so your hating me...

876
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:38,940
..is understandable.

877
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:46,820
They said Soo-ah died alone
at the dam,

878
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,080
so who took this photo?

879
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:52,790
And what about the date, July 5th?

880
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,840
This is no fun.

881
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:06,050
I'll just finish what I was saying.

882
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:09,349
Listen carefully.
My story is really exciting.

883
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,849
<i>Ever heard
of post-hypnotic suggestion?</i>

884
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:14,269
<i>You suggest something
during hypnosis,</i>

885
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:17,020
<i>then it's performed
in your wakened state.</i>

886
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:21,030
Still haven't worked it out?

887
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:30,080
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

888
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:33,000
<i>What about you, you bastard?</i>

889
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,000
<i>We hypnotized both of you.</i>

890
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:45,720
<i>One fortunate thing was that,
compared to others,</i>

891
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,760
<i>both of you
were receptive to hypnosis.</i>

892
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:51,389
<i>Isn't this fun?</i>

893
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:56,020
<i>One word gets you pregnant.
Another makes you fall in love.</i>

894
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,939
But no matter how receptive
you two were to hypnosis,

895
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,739
and no matter how good
a hypnotist Miss Yoo is,

896
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:09,990
getting people
to fall in love isn't easy.

897
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:13,700
Do you know how we did it?

898
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:19,249
Your first suggestion, of course,

899
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,419
was to go to that restaurant

900
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:24,510
straight after your release.

901
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:28,760
Next, to react
to the mobile phone's ringtone.

902
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:34,060
When you heard this,
you were programmed to say something.

903
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:36,560
Who are you?

904
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:39,809
Do you

905
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:41,770
like your clothes?

906
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:45,859
<i>And Mido was programmed
to react to the man</i>

907
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:47,609
<i>who would say this.</i>

908
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:51,660
<i>When she touched your hand,
your reaction would be...</i>

909
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,790
Your gravest mistake
wasn't failing to find the answer.

910
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:01,209
If you keep

911
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:05,169
asking the wrong questions,
you'll never find the right answer.

912
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:10,179
It's not,
"Why did Woo-jin imprison me?"

913
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,099
It's "Why did he release me?"

914
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,470
Once again...

915
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:20,600
..why did Woo-jin
release Dae-su after...

916
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:24,270
..15 years?

917
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:29,110
LAUGH, AND THE WORLD LAUGHS
WITH YOU. WEEP, AND YOU WEEP
ALONE.

918
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,540
<i>Mr Han.</i>

919
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,970
<i>Mr Han!</i>

920
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,890
Mido...

921
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:12,100
Mido doesn't know?

922
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:19,490
Why did you hide her there?

923
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:24,619
Did you think he'd hate me
just because I cut off his hand?

924
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:27,280
Didn't you work out
that it was a trap?

925
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,870
How can you protect your woman
with that brain?

926
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:38,210
I've secretly been raising Mido
since she was three.

927
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:41,630
What's wrong with you?

928
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:44,390
Mr Park's hand?

929
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:47,470
You moron.

930
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:52,639
Did you see his new prison? I gave
him that building for his hand!

931
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,350
Me!

932
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:20,340
Dae-su!

933
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,929
In front of me

934
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:26,179
there's some kind of box.

935
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:28,510
He's telling me to open it.

936
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,599
It's the same violet box...

937
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,060
No!

938
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,889
No, Mido, don't.

939
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:37,479
Don't open it, no matter what.

940
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,939
Or something terrible will happen.

941
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:43,570
What's in it?
You know, don't you?

942
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:46,570
Mido, just wait a little longer.

943
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:48,779
Dae-su will be there soon.

944
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:52,290
I'll be there very soon.

945
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:56,540
Can't you come now?

946
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,879
I'm scared.

947
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:02,049
Little Mido, you can wait, can't you?

948
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:03,670
Yes.

949
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:06,880
Very good. Good girl.

950
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:11,640
I'll call you back very soon, OK?

951
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:27,910
Please.

952
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:33,040
Don't tell Mido.

953
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:39,460
What has she done wrong?

954
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,550
You know it was all my fault.

955
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:49,050
I have...

956
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:52,810
..committed an unforgivable sin...

957
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:55,600
..against your sister.

958
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:59,560
And I also...

959
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:02,480
..did you wrong.

960
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,070
But...

961
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:09,070
..please leave Mido alone.

962
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:15,950
If by any chance...

963
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,500
..Mido finds out the truth,

964
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,500
you son of a bitch,

965
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:26,760
I'll tear you limb from limb.

966
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:31,719
And your remains will never be found.

967
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,259
Why?

968
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:36,430
Because I'm going
to swallow every last bit.

969
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,100
Woo-jin!

970
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,359
Please, sir, I made a mistake.

971
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,819
Please forget what I said.

972
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,650
Sir! Woo-jin!

973
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:54,700
We're Evergreen Old Boys, remember?

974
01:43:55,240 --> 01:44:01,790
<i>With the energy
of a green pine tree</i>

975
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:08,550
<i>The Great Sangnok High...</i>

976
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:14,969
I'll do whatever you want.

977
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:17,600
I'll do anything. I beg you.

978
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:23,099
Woo-jin, if you want me
to be your dog, I will!

979
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:27,189
From this moment on,
I am Woo-jin's dog!

980
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:28,730
I'm your bitch.

981
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:37,530
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

982
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:40,749
I'm a dog. I'll guard your house.

983
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:43,870
I'll be your slave.

984
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,000
The box...

985
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,180
..just leave it closed.

986
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,110
Now...

987
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:17,530
..what will I live for?

988
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:21,180
<i>Dae-su.</i>

989
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:23,640
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

990
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:26,260
<i>But I'll endure it.</i>

991
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,720
<i>You must understand.</i>

992
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:56,210
My sister and I loved each other,
despite everything.

993
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:02,380
Can you two do the same?

994
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:46,720
Soo-ah.

995
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,940
Woo-jin.

996
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,820
I know you've always been afraid.

997
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:13,410
So just let go of me.

998
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:33,350
Please remember me.

999
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,570
I have no regrets. Do you?

1000
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:33,619
<i>This is the whole adventure
of my life until now.</i>

1001
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:37,660
<i>Thank you for listening
to this terrible story to the end.</i>

1002
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:42,459
<i>I trust that you will understand
my sending a letter</i>

1003
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:46,259
<i>instead of talking to you in person.</i>

1004
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,339
<i>This is because
I have no tongue.</i>

1005
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:51,510
To be honest,
there's no reason I should help you.

1006
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:58,770
But there was one thing.

1007
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:02,270
I was touched by this last sentence.

1008
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:09,609
EVEN THOUGH
I'M NO BETTER THAN A BEAST,

1009
01:52:09,610 --> 01:52:13,620
DON'T I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE?

1010
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:19,540
The hypnosis may go wrong
and distort your memories.

1011
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,750
Do you want to proceed?

1012
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:45,810
If you're ready...

1013
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:49,650
..Iook at that tree.

1014
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:07,880
The tree...

1015
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:11,970
..is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar.

1016
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,520
You're now
inside Lee Woo-jin's penthouse.

1017
01:53:25,150 --> 01:53:27,310
<i>It's a dreary night.</i>

1018
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:33,069
<i>The sound of your footsteps
crossing to the window</i>

1019
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:35,410
<i>fills the room.</i>

1020
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:53,090
<i>When I ring my bell...</i>

1021
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:57,430
<i>..you'll split into two people.</i>

1022
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:04,940
<i>One person doesn't know
your secret.: Oh Dae-su.</i>

1023
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:09,020
<i>The one who knows your secret
is the monster.</i>

1024
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:12,439
<i>When I ring the bell again,</i>

1025
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:16,030
<i>the monster will turn around
and start walking.</i>

1026
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:26,369
<i>With each step,
he will age by one year.</i>

1027
01:54:26,370 --> 01:54:29,750
<i>When he reaches 70,
the monster will die.</i>

1028
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,840
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

1029
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:35,550
<i>It will be a very peaceful death.</i>

1030
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,730
<i>Now, good luck to you.</i>

1031
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:29,440
What's going on?

1032
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:32,440
Look at you.

1033
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:03,220
Who were you with?

1034
01:56:58,650 --> 01:57:00,650
I love you...

1035
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,030
..Dae-su..
